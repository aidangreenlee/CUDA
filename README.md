# GPU Acceleration of Linear Algebra Operations
## 2020 Senior Project - UMAINE BS Physics

This repo contains GPU code written while learning CUDA, with an intent to demonstrate the value of GPU acceleration while creating a basis of code for accelerating matrix operations.
This code was benchmarked on the XSEDE supercomputer for all final results.

To compile, simply run `nvcc <filename>`
